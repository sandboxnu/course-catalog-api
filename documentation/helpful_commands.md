# Some Helpful Commands

## For Dev Work

#### Q: How do I connect to my dev database?

Run these commands one line at a time

- ```
  docker exec -it dev_postgresql_1 bash
  psql -U postgres
  \c searchneu_dev
  ```

## For AWS Infrastructure / Deployment

### Inside The Jumphost

#### Q: What is a jumphost?

A jump server, jump host or jump box is a system on a network used to access and manage devices in a separate security zone. For SearchNEU, the jumphost is an EC2 that can connect to the rest of the AWS infrastructure (database, elasticsearch, etc.)

#### Q: How do I run a production scrape?

- Check out `documentation/infrastructure/production_scrape.md` - it lists out the exact steps to do this

#### Q: How do I view or update data in production?

- `psql <DATABASE URL>` to connect to the staging or prod database and view/update data
  - Remember you can get the database URL from AWS Systems Manager -> Parameter Store

#### Q: How do I migrate majors data into the staging or prod database for Graduate?

- In `~/course-catalog-api` inside the Jumphost, run `DATABASE_URL=<DATABASE URL> yarn babel-node-ts scripts/migrate_major_data.ts`

### Not Inside The Jumphost (but related to the Jumphost)

#### Q: How I copy a local folder/file into the Jumphost?

- In a terminal on your machine, run `scp -i <PATH TO YOUR JUMPHOST PRIVATE KEY> <PATH TO SOME FOLDER/FILE> <JUMPHOST USER>@<JUMPHOST PUBLIC IP ADDRESS>:<DIRECTORY>`

### Deployment

#### Q: How do I deploy CCA code changes to staging or prod?

- Run `./infrastructure/aws/push-image` in `course-catalog-api` to push a new Docker image to AWS ECR with the `staging` tag
- Run `./infrastructure/aws/redeploy staging` in `course-catalog-api` to redeploy staging CCA with the latest Docker image tagged with `staging`
- Run `./infrastructure/aws/redeploy prod` in `course-catalog-api` to tag the latest `staging` Docker image with a `prod` tag and redeploy prod CCA using that image

## For Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is interacted via HTTP requests. If you're doing a lot of these to work with ES, I recommend downloading Postman to make this easier. All the commands below are HTTP requests you will make to localhost:9200 (your ES instance).

In general, \_cat requests are for all requests that check on the health/statuts of the ES client. To read more, visit this [API page](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search.html).

#### Q: How do I check on the Indexes I have on the elasticsearch client?

- GET localhost:9200/\_cat/indices
  - Example output will look like this: <br>
    yellow open classes_blue JB7XCWvASESQ8T7QgEo_bA 1 1 11607 0 3.6mb 3.6mb <br>
    yellow open employees_blue 9zolI39nS-icCxjMAJ-O_g 1 1 1 0 5.1kb 5.1kb
  - The main parts are the name "employees_blue" or "classes_blue" in this case, and the health status, in this case "yellow".
  - There are three status colors, yellow, green and red. We're always in yellow because shard setup, which is separate and complex discussion but TLDR yellow is fine.

#### Q: How do I check on the Aliases I have on the elasticsearch client?

- GET localhost:9200/\_cat/aliases
  - Example output will look like this: <br>
    employees employees_blue - - - <br>
    classes classes_blue - - -
  - The first column is the alias name, the second is the index name that the alias points to

#### Q: How do I execute a search generally?

- POST localhost:9200/\_search
- Body: { "query": { "match_all": {}}}
  - Be sure to use raw, JSON if you are using Postman
  - Example output should be a large JSON, with the first few relevant search results.
  - The hits object tells you how many documents were retrieved, and it's default capped to 10,000.
  - To learn more about what different queries to use in the body of the request, reference [Query DSL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html). Specifically, you can look a match queries.

#### Q: How do I execute a search on a specific index?

- POST localhost:9200/classes/\_search
- Body: { "query": { "match_all": {}}}
  - Same as above, but put the index name before search in the url.

#### Q: How do I reindex an index to another?

- POST localhost:9200/\_reindex
- Body {
  "source": {
  "index": "classes"
  },
  "dest": {
  "index": "classes_green"
  }
  }
  - the index in source is the index you're copying, the index in dest is the name of the index that will be created after copying the data from source.
  - Example output should be a JSON with details on the operation, if the status code is a 200 it succeeded.

#### Q: How do I change aliases?

- POST localhost:9200/\_aliases
- Body {
  "actions": [
  {
  "add": {
  "index": "classes_green",
  "alias": "classes1"
  }
  }
  ]
  }
  - This doesn't actually work for our index settup right now, because our aliases don't have the correct permissions. However, I thought it was worth mentioning.
  - This endpoint in general allows you to manage aliases witth the given actions you pass. Read more [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-aliases.html).

#### Q: How do I delete an index?

- DELETE localhost:9200/employees
  - Example output: {
    "acknowledged": true
    }
  - Specify the namee of the index in the url, in this case the employees index was deleted.
