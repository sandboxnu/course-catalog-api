 * Every time a user first loads the SearchNEU page, they need to know which semesters are available. It makes no
 *  sense to query Postgres every time - this isn't a scalable method, as Prisma (and psql) limit the number of connections.
 * Instead, we can cache the list of terms, only updating it every once in a while (and not on a user-by-user basis)
