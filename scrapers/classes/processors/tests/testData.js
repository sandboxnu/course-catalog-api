// This file is responsible for loading the termDump.json and giving different instances of the data to each test.
// It needs to give different instances of the data to each test because the tests modify the data.
// Can use as much RAM as needed.
// It takes about 43 ms to JSON.parse the string. It takes lodash about 80 ms to _.cloneDeep the JS object.
// A way to make this seem faster would be to pre-create a bunch of clones of the data and then store them in RAM,
// and then return them when they are needed, and clone it more times for later.
