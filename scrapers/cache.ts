// This file is responsible for caching things during development mode
// It doesn't run at all in production or testing
// It works just like a key-value store,
// they key is just split into three parts - folder, filename, and keyname
// It saves a different hash map to disk at each folder/filename combo (eg searchneu/cache/dev_data/EllucianCatalogParser.cache.msgpack).
// Each key in the hash map maps to the value passed in the set method.
// This is used in two places in the codebase: to cache HTTP requests for the scrapers, and the output from each parser
// When an HTTP request in the scrapers is made in development, its response is cached to disk with this file
// This way, while developing the code when you make another request, it will load from disk instead of the net (much faster)
// The data will be outdated, but that doesn't matter for dev.

// When this is called from the requests the folder is set to macros.REQUESTS_CACHE_DIR
// and when it is called from the parsers it is set to macros.DEV_DATA_DIR.

// If we want to ever make this better in the future, we could add a feature to append to an existing json/msgpack buffer
// instead of decoding and re-encoding the entire buffer over again every time we save.

// Quick history of caching the http requests:
// The first attempt used a separate file for each request
// This caused around 98k files to end up in the folder for the classes
// Each file was stored as a the response to the http request.toJSON()
// Was cool because could load up some requests at a time without loading the entire cache.
// Problems:
// Sometimes got EMFILE issues on linux (can't open that many files at once)
// Windows explorer and other programs (ls) weren't happy with 98k files in one folder

// Take 2 was using dirty:
// https://github.com/felixge/node-dirty
// Slower than having each request in its own file (:O)

// Take 3, Use msgpack and just save to disk.
// Unsure if msgpack can append to data that is already encoded.
// Currently re-encoding everything and saving the entire db every so often
// Much faster than JSON, but not human readable (~x6 faster)

// If ever looking at changing the library used to back this,
// https://github.com/Level/levelup
// might be worth looking at

// Right now this is used to cache dev data and http requests to speed up development.
