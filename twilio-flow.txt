=== General Flow ===
In the search results, next to each section there's a "Sign Up for SMS Notifications" button
Clicking button opens popup with an input "Enter your phone number"
  - Maybe some disclaimer saying we'll only text you about class openings and won't share your phone #, etc
  - Also validate invalid phone #s, e.g. if you enter "123" it says "123" is not a valid phone #, gives an example of a valid phone #
    - Do we need to prevent "off limits" #s? e.g. what if someone enters 911
  - Popup is closeable at any time
Type in phone #, click "Save Phone #"
Popup changes, says "We sent a verification message to [ur #], please verify your phone # by replying with "VERIFY" within the next 10 minutes (verification message will have same instructions)
  - Button on popup to re-send verification (might have to prevent spam, debounce to 30 seconds)
After user replies "VERIFY", popup goes away, save phone # to session cookie (use socket.io)
Where the "Sign Up for SMS Notifications" buttons used to be there is now a toggle next to each section
Clicking on toggle signs phone # up for SMS notifs

=== Misc ===
User can text "STATUS" (maybe come up with better name?) to see a list of all sections/courses they are currently signed up for
  - Might have to split across multiple messages if they sign up for a lot
User can text "STOP ALL" to completely remove themselves from all notifs
"HELP" to see list of commands
If session cookie exists then top right of page header has a "Current Phone #: 123-456-7890" text, with a button "Change Phone #" -> clicking deletes session cookie, opens the popup

=== Verification Logic (socket.io) ===
User hits "Save Phone #" button
Frontend creates socket connection to backend
Frontend sends Phone # thru socket
Backend stores map of Phone # to socket, rejects if entry already exists for this phone # (this would mean 2 diff users are trying to verify the same phone # at same time)
Backend sends twilio message to phone # asking to reply "VERIFY"
Backend twilio endpoint receives "VERIFY" text from user, gets socket from map
Backend sends cookie thru socket to frontend, closes socket
Frontend socket listens for cookie, upon receiving cookie frontend stores in session, closes popup

=== Database ===

=== Questions for Us/Khoury OH ===
Add database table + service logic to CCA or new backend repo?
Lump in with CCA:
Pro: Simpler notifyer, no need for network request with ALL updated courses
Pro: Can re-use existing infrastructure
Con: Lumping in SearchNEU-specific-logic with CCA

General flow
Twilio-specific intrastructure?
