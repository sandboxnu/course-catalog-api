=== General Flow ===
In the search results, next to each section there's a "Sign Up for SMS Notifications" button
Clicking button opens popup with an input "Enter your phone number"
  - Maybe some disclaimer saying we'll only text you about class openings and won't share your phone #, etc
  - Also validate invalid phone #s, e.g. if you enter "123" it says "123" is not a valid phone #, gives an example of a valid phone #
    - Do we need to prevent "off limits" #s? e.g. what if someone enters 911
  - Popup is closeable at any time
Type in phone #, click "Save Phone #"
Popup changes, says "We sent a verification code to [ur #]
  - Button on popup to re-send verification (might have to prevent spam, debounce to 30 seconds)
User enters code, send post to backend with phone # + code, if correct then backend responds with signed JWT containing phone #
Where the "Sign Up for SMS Notifications" buttons used to be there is now a toggle next to each section
Clicking on toggle signs phone # up for SMS notifs

=== Misc ===
User can text "STATUS" (maybe come up with better name?) to see a list of all sections/courses they are currently signed up for
  - Might have to split across multiple messages if they sign up for a lot
User can text "STOP ALL" to completely remove themselves from all notifs
"HELP" to see list of commands
If session cookie exists then top right of page header has a "Current Phone #: 123-456-7890" text, with a button "Change Phone #" -> clicking deletes session cookie, opens the popup

=== Misc TODOs ===
Extract twilio endpoint into frontend environment variable
Remove all 'showNotificationSwitches' since we're gonna always show them the signup button
Remove all unused code (e.g. custom hooks) (check git deletions/commented out code)
Remove all prior 'jwt' code, no longer used (in frontend)
Add docs for configuring incoming SMS webhook (https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/tutorials/how-to-receive-and-reply-node-js)
  - ngrok (https://ngrok.com/download), mv ngrok /usr/local/bin, ngrok http 8080, put ngrok-generated-URL in Twilio config
Add better default message (e.g. explain possible commands)
Add "STATUS" case
Change notif toggle to flip BEFORE sending network request to reduce lag, display success banner when req finishes or display error banner (and un-toggle) if fails 

=== Deployment TODOs ===
Get Twilio paid account
  - configure SMS listener to forward to search URL
  - Configure Twilio environment variables
    - Backend:
        TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
        TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
        TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER
        TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_ID
        CLIENT_ORIGIN
        JWT_SECRET
    - Frontend:
        ???
