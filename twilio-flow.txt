=== General Flow ===
In the search results, next to each section there's a "Sign Up for SMS Notifications" button
Clicking button opens popup with an input "Enter your phone number"
  - Maybe some disclaimer saying we'll only text you about class openings and won't share your phone #, etc
  - Also validate invalid phone #s, e.g. if you enter "123" it says "123" is not a valid phone #, gives an example of a valid phone #
    - Do we need to prevent "off limits" #s? e.g. what if someone enters 911
  - Popup is closeable at any time
Type in phone #, click "Save Phone #"
Popup changes, says "We sent a verification code to [ur #]
  - Button on popup to re-send verification (might have to prevent spam, debounce to 30 seconds)
User enters code, send post to backend with phone # + code, if correct then backend responds with signed JWT containing phone #
Where the "Sign Up for SMS Notifications" buttons used to be there is now a toggle next to each section
Clicking on toggle signs phone # up for SMS notifs

=== Misc ===
User can text "STATUS" (maybe come up with better name?) to see a list of all sections/courses they are currently signed up for
  - Might have to split across multiple messages if they sign up for a lot
User can text "STOP ALL" to completely remove themselves from all notifs
"HELP" to see list of commands
If session cookie exists then top right of page header has a "Current Phone #: 123-456-7890" text, with a button "Change Phone #" -> clicking deletes session cookie, opens the popup

=== Misc TODOs ===
Extract twilio endpoint into frontend environment variable
Remove all 'showNotificationSwitches' since we're gonna always show them the signup button
Remove all unused code (e.g. custom hooks) (check git deletions/commented out code)
Remove all prior 'jwt' code, no longer used (in frontend)
Add docs for configuring incoming SMS webhook (https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/tutorials/how-to-receive-and-reply-node-js)
  - ngrok (https://ngrok.com/download), mv ngrok /usr/local/bin, ngrok http 8080, put ngrok-generated-URL in Twilio config
Add better default message (e.g. explain possible commands)
Add "STATUS" case

=== Deployment TODOs ===
Get Twilio paid account
  - configure SMS listener to forward to search URL
  - Configure Twilio environment variables
    - Backend:
        TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
        TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
        TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER
        TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_ID
        CLIENT_ORIGIN
        JWT_SECRET
    - Frontend:
        ???
